      <description>Overview #  Apache Paimon(incubating) is a streaming data lake platform that supports high-speed data ingestion, change data tracking and efficient real-time analytics.
Architecture #  As shown in the architecture above:
Read/Write: Paimon supports a versatile way to read/write data and perform OLAP queries.
 For reads, it supports consuming data  from historical snapshots (in batch mode), from the latest offset (in streaming mode), or reading incremental snapshots in a hybrid way.</description>

      <description>Basic Concepts #  Snapshot #  A snapshot captures the state of a table at some point in time. Users can access the latest data of a table through the latest snapshot. By time traveling, users can also access the previous state of a table through an earlier snapshot.
Partition #  Paimon adopts the same partitioning concept as Apache Hive to separate data.
Partitioning is an optional way of dividing a table into related parts based on the values of particular columns like date, city, and department.</description>

      <description>File Layouts #  All files of a table are stored under one base directory. Paimon files are organized in a layered style. The following image illustrates the file layout. Starting from a snapshot file, Paimon readers can recursively access all records from the table.
Snapshot Files #  All snapshot files are stored in the snapshot directory.
A snapshot file is a JSON file containing information about this snapshot, including</description>

      <description>File Operations #  This article is specifically designed to clarify the impact that various file operations have on files.
This page provides concrete examples and practical tips for effectively managing them. Furthermore, through an in-depth exploration of operations such as commit and compact, we aim to offer insights into the creation and updates of files.

      <title>Primary Key Table</title>

      <description>Primary Key Table #  Changelog table is the default table type when creating a table. Users can insert, update or delete records in the table.
Primary keys are a set of columns that are unique for each record. Paimon imposes an ordering of data, which means the system will sort the primary key within each bucket. Using this feature, users can achieve high performance by adding filter conditions on the primary key.</description>

      <title>Append Only Table</title>

      <description>Append Only Table #  If a table does not have a primary key defined, it is an append-only table by default.
You can only insert a complete record into the table. No delete or update is supported and you cannot define primary keys. This type of table is suitable for use cases that do not require updates (such as log data synchronization).
Bucketing #  You can also define bucket number for Append-only table, see Bucket.</description>

      <description>External Log Systems #  Aside from underlying table files, changelog of Paimon can also be stored into or consumed from an external log system, such as Kafka. By specifying log.system table property, users can choose which external log system to use.
If an external log system is used, all records written into table files will also be written into the log system. Changes produced by the streaming queries will thus come from the log system instead of table files.</description>
